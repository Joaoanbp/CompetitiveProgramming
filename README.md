## Competitive Programming Solutions
A curated collection of my solutions, notes, and practice problems from various online judges and contests. This repository serves as a personal log of my journey in competitive programming, focusing on improving algorithmic and problem-solving skills.

## 🚀 Platforms and Contests
This repository contains my solutions for problems from the following platforms:

LeetCode: Algorithm challenges and weekly/bi-weekly contests.

Beecrowd (URI): Problems in Portuguese, ideal for practicing fundamental concepts.

Codeforces: Contests and problemsets from one of the most popular competitive programming communities.

## 📁 Repository Structure
The repository is organized to make it easy to navigate through problems and platforms.

Platforms: Each main directory (LeetCode, Beecrowd, Codeforces) represents a different online judge.

Problems: Within each platform folder, solutions are organized by problem name or ID.

Code: Each solution is contained in a single file, typically named solution.cpp or similar, depending on the language used.
